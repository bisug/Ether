## Sovereignty & Security

Ether is engineered to eliminate the most common security risks in the userbot ecosystem.

*   **Zero String Session Reliance**: No third-party bots or risky session generators. Ether uses the official Telegram native authentication flow.
*   **Direct Auth**: Use the `/login` command to trigger an official Telegram OTP/2FA flow directly to your device.
*   **Encrypted Storage**: Your session data is stored securely on *your* server. It never touches a developer's database or public logs.
*   **No Middleware Risks**: Your credentials remain private. No Replit, no external middleware, just direct communication with Telegram servers.

---

## Key Features

*   **Hybrid Engine**: Orchestrates Telethon (Userbot) and Telegram Bot API concurrently for maximum flexibility.
*   **Plug-and-Play**: Drop any `.py` script into the `plugins/` directory to instantly extend functionality.
*   **Native Async**: Fully asynchronous architecture powered by `pymongo` native async drivers for high-concurrency handling.
*   **Health Monitoring**: Integrated FastAPI heartbeat service for 100% uptime on cloud providers.
*   **Containerized**: Production-ready Docker configuration for seamless local or cloud orchestration.

</div>

### Quick Start Guides

#### 1. Cloud Hosting (Render - Recommended)
Render provides the most stable environment for Ether with native Docker support.
1.  **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  Click the **Deploy to Render** button above.
3.  Connect your GitHub account and select the forked repository.
4.  Configure the **Environment Variables** (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
    *   **Crucial:** Ensure `WEB_SERVICE` is set to `true` to prevent the service from sleeping.
5.  Render will automatically build and deploy the container.

---

### Keep-Alive & Automation (Cloud)

Cloud providers like Render often put free-tier apps to "sleep" after inactivity. Use these tools to ensure Ether stays online 24/7.

#### UptimeRobot (Keep-Alive)
To prevent Render from sleeping, set up a monitor to ping your bot's URL:
1.  Go to [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) and create a free account.
2.  Click **Add New Monitor**.
3.  **Monitor Type**: `HTTP(s)`
4.  **Friendly Name**: `Ether Userbot`
5.  **URL**: Your Render app URL (e.g., `https://your-app.onrender.com/`)
6.  **Monitoring Interval**: Every `5 minutes`.
7.  Click **Create Monitor**.

#### Cron-job.org (Scheduled Tasks)
If you need to trigger specific bot actions or ensure the web service remains active via external triggers:
1.  Create an account at [Cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/).
2.  Create a **New Cronjob**.
3.  **URL**: Your Render app URL.
4.  **Schedule**: Every 5 or 10 minutes.
5.  This acts as a secondary heart-beat for your bot.

---

#### 2. Heroku Deployment
Ideal for users familiar with the Heroku ecosystem.
1.  Click the **Deploy to Heroku** button above.
2.  Enter a unique app name and fill in the required environment variables.
3.  Once the build finishes, go to the **Resources** tab.
4.  **Important:** Turn off the `web` dyno and turn **ON** the `worker` dyno.
5.  Render will automatically build and deploy the container.

---

#### 3. JustRunMyApp (One-Click)
A simple, zero-config deployment platform.
1.  Click the **Deploy Now** button for JustRunMyApp above.
2.  Paste the repository URL: `https://github.com/LearningBotsOfficial/Ether`
3.  Follow the on-screen prompts to set your Environment Variables.
4.  Launch the app and wait for the status to show "Running".

#### 4. Docker Deployment (Local / VPS)
The preferred method for developers and privacy-focused users.
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LearningBotsOfficial/Ether.git && cd Ether

# 2. Create and configure your .env file
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# 3. Build and launch with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d --build
```
> [!TIP]
> Using Docker Compose handles the health checks and automatic restarts for you.

#### 5. Manual Setup (Linux / VPS / Windows)
For users who want full control over the environment.

1. **Install uv**
   If you haven't installed `uv` on your server yet:
   - **Linux/macOS:**
     ```bash
     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```powershell
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
     ```

2. **Prepare the Project**
   Clone your repository and enter the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LearningBotsOfficial/Ether
   cd Ether
   ```

3. **Setup the Environment**
   Instead of creating a venv and activating it manually, let `uv` handle everything:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
   This command will:
   - Check if you have the correct Python version (defined in `.python-version` or `pyproject.toml`). If not, it will automatically download it.
   - Create a `.venv` directory.
   - Install all dependencies exactly as defined in `uv.lock`.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Copy the example environment file and edit it with your credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Or your preferred editor
   ```

5. **Run the Bot**
   You can run the bot directly using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

### Managing Dependencies & Upgrading

`uv` uses a lockfile (`uv.lock`) to ensure that your environment is always reproducible.

#### Adding or Removing Packages
To add a new library:
```bash
uv add <package-name>
```
To remove a library:
```bash
uv remove <package-name>
```

#### Upgrading All Packages
To upgrade all dependencies to their latest compatible versions and update the `uv.lock` file:
```bash
uv lock --upgrade
```

#### Syncing Environment
Whenever you pull new changes from GitHub that include an updated `uv.lock`, simply run:
```bash
uv sync
```
This ensures your local `.venv` matches the project's requirements perfectly.

---

### Post-Deployment: Authentication

Unlike traditional userbots, Ether doesn't use risky "String Sessions". Follow these steps to authorize your account:

1.  Open your bot on Telegram (the one created via `@BotFather`).
2.  Send the `/login` command.
3.  The bot will prompt you for your phone number.
4.  Enter the OTP sent by Telegram (and your 2FA password if enabled).
5.  **Success!** Your session is now securely stored in your own MongoDB database.

## Plugin Development

Ether is built to be modular. You can add new features by creating a `.py` file in the `plugins/` directory. Each plugin must implement a `setup` function.

### The Setup Function
```python
def setup(ether, db, owner_id):
    """
    ether: The Telethon TelegramClient instance.
    db: The MongoDB motor database instance.
    owner_id: The numeric ID of the bot owner.
    """
```

### Pro Plugin Example: `notes.py`
This example shows how to use the database to save and retrieve simple notes.

```python
from telethon import events

def setup(ether, db, owner_id):
    # Collection reference
    notes = db["notes"]

    @ether.on(events.NewMessage(pattern=r"^\.save (\w+) (.+)$", outgoing=True))
    async def save_note(event):
        if event.sender_id != owner_id: return
        
        name = event.pattern_match.group(1)
        text = event.pattern_match.group(2)
        
        await notes.update_one(
            {"name": name}, 
            {"$set": {"content": text}}, 
            upsert=True
        )
        await event.edit(f"Note '{name}' saved successfully.")

    @ether.on(events.NewMessage(pattern=r"^\.getnote (\w+)$", outgoing=True))
    async def get_note(event):
        if event.sender_id != owner_id: return
        
        name = event.pattern_match.group(1)
        note = await notes.find_one({"name": name})
        
        if note:
            await event.edit(f"**Note {name}:**\n{note['content']}")
        else:
            await event.edit("Note not found.")
```
